# 🌩 Nimbus – A SwiftUI Reference & Learning App  
![app logo](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*bYfoIXR9AvmNMhbhnZSI0g.png)

**Nimbus** is an open-source SwiftUI reference and learning tool built for iOS developers who want to explore, study, and contribute to beautiful SwiftUI components. It’s organized by category and designed to be both educational and practical.

What started as a personal way to document and reuse my own SwiftUI views has evolved into a collaborative space for learning and sharing. Each component — or "Topic" — is meant to not only be reused, but understood.

---

## 📦 Features

- Browse SwiftUI components organized by category  
- View example code and breakdowns of key modifiers  
- Learn from clean, well-commented implementations  
- Star/favorite your go-to views  
- Contribute your own views and explanations

---

## 🧱 What’s a Topic?

Each view in Nimbus is called a **Topic**, and every Topic includes:

- ✅ `name`: The title of the component  
- 🧾 `description`: What it does and why it’s useful  
- 🏷 `category`: e.g., layout, animation, inputs, etc.  
- ⚙️ `iOS version`: Minimum OS compatibility  
- 🧩 `modifiersUsed`: List of SwiftUI modifiers it demonstrates  
- 📄 `sourceCode`: The actual SwiftUI code shown in the app  
- 🔗 `documentationLinks`: (optional) Apple docs, blog posts  
- 🧑‍💻 `githubURL`: (optional) original source or repo reference  

You can see examples in the [models and examples folder](https://github.com/SeckMohameth/Nimbus/tree/main/Nimbus/Model).

```

1. Open the project in Xcode  
2. Run the app on a simulator or device
3. Browse Topics and view code samples directly in the app
