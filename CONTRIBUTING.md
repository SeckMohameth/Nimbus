1. **A SwiftUI view** in its own file or within the appropriate category.

```swift
Topic(
    name: "My Custom Card View",
    description: "A reusable card layout with rounded corners and shadow.",
    category: .layout,
    iOSVersion: "16.0",
    modifiersUsed: ["padding()", "background()", "cornerRadius()", "shadow()"],
    sourceCode: """
    struct MyCustomCardView: View {
        var body: some View {
            VStack {
                Text("Hello, Nimbus!")
                    .padding()
                    .background(Color.blue)
                    .cornerRadius(12)
                    .shadow(radius: 5)
